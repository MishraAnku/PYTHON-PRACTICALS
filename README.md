# PYTHON-PRACTICALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ON PYTHON
ABOUT PRACTICAL:
Here's a general breakdown of how Python practical work and some common types of exercises:
1.	Problem Statement: Each practical typically begins with a problem statement or a description of the task to be accomplished. This could involve anything from simple arithmetic calculations to more complex tasks like data manipulation, algorithm implementation, or building software applications.
2.	Understanding Requirements: It's crucial to carefully read and understand the requirements of the practical before starting to write any code. This involves breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and identifying what inputs the program should take and what outputs it should produce.
3.	Algorithm Design: Once you understand the problem, you need to design an algorithm or a step-by-step procedure to solve it. This may involve techniques such as iteration, recursion, conditional statements, and data manipulation operations.
4.	Writing Code: With the algorithm in mind, you can start writing Python code to implement the solution. This involves translating your algorithm into Python syntax using appropriate data types, functions, loops, and other language constructs.
5.	Testing and Debugging: After writing the code, it's essential to test it with different inputs to ensure that it produces the correct outputs and handles edge cases properly. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing any errors or bugs in the code.
6.	Optimization (if necessary): Depending on the complexity of the problem, you may need to optimize your code to improve its efficiency or reduce its runtime. This could involve techniques such as algorithmic optimization, data structure selection, or code refactoring.
